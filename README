## Description

This project is client-server application, that tunnels data through DNS queries.

The client application sends data to the server. Activity stops when entire input file is sent.

The server application listens on the port 53. Incoming data will be saved to the specified file.

Two applications communicate with IPv4 as a network protocol and UDP as a transport protocol, data is encoded/decoded using base32

TCP or IPv6 is not supported
